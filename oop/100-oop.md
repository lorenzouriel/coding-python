# OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data (attributes) and code (methods). Python is an object-oriented programming language that fully supports OOP principles. Here are the key concepts of OOP in Python:

**1. Class:** A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that an object of that class will have. In Python, a class is defined using the class keyword. A class is a set of objects, an object that has dependent objects (Class = blueprint). **Classes are written in Pascal format (carBluePrint())**

**2. Object:** An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific instance of the class, with its own unique attributes and methods. You can create multiple objects from the same class. **They are real-life objects and have attributes and methods**

**3. Attributes:** Attributes are the data stored within an object. They represent the state of the object and are defined within the class. **Define objects, modeled by variables *(What they have)***

**4. Methods:** Methods are functions defined within a class that operate on objects of that class. They can access and modify the object's attributes. **What objects can do, modeled by functions *(What they do)***

**5. Constructor:** The constructor method (`__init__`) is a special method used to initialize newly created objects. **It is called automatically when an object is created.**

**6. Inheritance:** Inheritance is the ability of a class to **inherit attributes and methods from another class (called the superclass or parent class).** It allows for code reuse and promotes a hierarchical structure.

**7. Encapsulation:** It helps in hiding the internal implementation details and prevents external code from directly accessing or modifying the object's state. It allows you to control access to the internal state of an object, **ensuring that the object's data is accessed and modified only through well-defined interfaces (methods), while hiding the internal implementation details.**

**8. Polymorphism:** Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It **enables a single interface to be used for different data types or classes.**

Here's a simple example demonstrating OOP concepts in Python:
```python
class Car: 
    def __init__(self, make, model, year): 
        # Attributes 
        self.make = make 
        self.model = model 
        self.year = year 
        self.is_running = False  # Additional attribute to track whether the car is running

    # Methods 
    def start_engine(self): 
        print(f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}'s engine is now running.") 
        self.is_running = True

    def stop_engine(self): 
        print(f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}'s engine is now stopped.") 
        self.is_running = False

    def honk(self): 
        print(f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model} says Honk! Honk!")

# Creating objects (instances) of the Car class 
car1 = Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2022) 
car2 = Car("Honda", "Accord", 2023)

# Accessing attributes 
print(f"Car 1: {car1.year} {car1.make} {car1.model}") 
print(f"Car 2: {car2.year} {car2.make} {car2.model}")

# Calling methods 
car1.start_engine() 
car2.start_engine()

# Honking the horns 
car1.honk() 
car2.honk()

# Stopping the engines 
car1.stop_engine() 
car2.stop_engine()
```

**In this example:**
- **Objects (`car1` and `car2`):** Objects are instances of the `Car` class. **They represent two individual cars with specific attributes.**

- **Attributes (`make`, `model`, `year`, and `is_running`):** These are the **properties that define the state of each car.** is_running is an additional attribute to track whether the car's engine is running.

- **Methods (`start_engine`, `stop_engine`, and `honk`):** These are the **behaviors or actions that the cars can perform.** For example, starting and stopping the engine or honking the horn.

- **Class (`Car`):** The class Car serves as a model for creating car objects. It **defines the attributes and methods that all instances of the class will have.**

When you run this program, you'll see output indicating the actions taken by each car. This is a basic example, but it demonstrates the fundamental concepts of OOP: `classes`, `objects`, `attributes`, and `methods`.
