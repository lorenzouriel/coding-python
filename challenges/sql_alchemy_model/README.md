### SQLAlchemy Intermediate Challenge

This challenge will focus on creating two related tables, `Product` and `Supplier`, using SQLAlchemy. 

Each product will have an associated supplier, demonstrating the use of `foreign keys` to establish relationships between tables. 

Additionally, you will perform `insertions` into these tables to practice data manipulation.
