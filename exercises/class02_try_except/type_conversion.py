# Type conversion, also known as casting, is the process of converting the value of a variable from one type to another. Python offers several built-in functions to perform explicit type conversions, such as int(), float(), str(), etc.

int_number = 5
float_number = 2.5

# Convert the integer to float and realize the sum
my_sum = float(int_number) + float_number
print(my_sum)
