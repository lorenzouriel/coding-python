# The for loop is used to iterate over items in any sequence, such as lists, strings, or dictionary objects, and execute a block of code for each item. 
# It is especially useful when you need to perform an operation for each element in a collection.

# Python's for command iterates over the items in any sequence (whether a list or a string), in the order they appear in the sequence.


# Measure some strings:
words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
for w in words:
    print(w, len(w))


# Measure some strings:
name = ['Lorenzo']
for letter in name:
    print(letter)
