# ORM 
**ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping.** It's a **programming technique that allows developers to interact with a relational database using an object-oriented approach.**

In other words, it facilitates the **conversion between data stored in relational databases and the objects used in object-oriented programming languages like Python.**

**Database to Code:**
- An object (code) will be a line in the table (database) - `Object <---> Line`
- A class (code) will be a table (database) - `Class <---> Table`
- An attribute (code) will be a column (database) - `Attribute <---> Column` 

The primary goal of ORM is to **bridge the gap** between the relational model of databases and the object-oriented model of programming languages. 

This simplifies database operations by allowing developers to work with objects and classes rather than directly dealing with SQL queries and database tables.

**Here's how ORM typically works:**

**1. Mapping:** ORM frameworks **provide mechanisms for mapping database tables to classes and database rows to objects.** Each class in the application corresponds to a table in the database, and each instance of the class represents a row in that table.

**2. Abstraction:** ORM abstracts away the complexities of SQL queries and database operations, **allowing developers to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using object-oriented syntax and methods.** This makes database interactions more intuitive.

**3. Querying:** ORM frameworks often **provide query APIs that allow developers to perform complex database queries using high-level constructs, such as method chaining or query builder patterns.** These queries are translated into SQL by the ORM framework and executed against the database.

**4. Relationships:** ORM frameworks **support defining relationships between classes (objects) that correspond to foreign key relationships between tables in the database.** This allows developers to navigate and manipulate related objects using object-oriented syntax.

**5. Schema Migration:** Some ORM frameworks **include tools for managing database schema changes and migrations.** This allows developers to define database schema changes using code (such as Python classes or migration scripts) and apply those changes to the database automatically.

**6. Prevent SQL Injection:** ORM also helps prevent SQL injection attacks. **Because SQL queries are automatically generated by the ORM, user-supplied data is handled securely, reducing the risk of exploiting security vulnerabilities.**

Popular ORM frameworks in Python include SQL Model, SQLAlchemy, Django ORM (part of the Django web framework), and Peewee.
