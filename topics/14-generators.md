# Generators
In Python, **a generator is a special kind of iterator**

It allows you to **iterate over a set of items without creating the entire set in memory at once**

This is particularly useful for large datasets or when you want to create an infinite sequence

Generators are defined using the `yield` keyword instead of `return`, and they can be **iterated over using a loop or consumed using other generator functions.**

**Here's a simple example of a `generator` function:**
```python
def countdown(n):
    while n > 0:
        yield n
        n -= 1


# Using the generator
for i in countdown(5):
    print(i)
```
- *In this example, `countdown` is a generator function that `yields` values from `n` down to `1`. When you use it in a for loop, it will generate values one at a time without storing all of them in memory.*

**Another Example:**
```python
def my_generator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3


# Using the generator in a loop
for value in my_generator():
    print(value)

# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
```
- Generators can also be used to produce an infinite sequence of values. 

**For example, the following generator generates an infinite sequence of Fibonacci numbers:**
```python
def fibonacci():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

# Using the generator to print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
fib_gen = fibonacci()
for _ in range(10):
    print(next(fib_gen))

# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 5
# 8
# 13
# 21
# 34
```
- **`fibonacci()` is a generator function** that `yields` Fibonacci numbers indefinitely. We use **next(fib_gen) to consume values from the generator one at a time.**
